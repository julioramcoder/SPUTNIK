#Area of a triangle
#The first thing that we need to do is ask to user the size

Base=int(input("please type the valor of the measurement Base: "))
Height=int(input("please type the valor of the measurement Height: "))

#then we are gonna calculate the area with:
AREA=(Base*Height)/2
print("THE RESULT IS: ",AREA)
