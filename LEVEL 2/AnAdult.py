#no we get to ask to the user his age
#in this case the way that we know how to make a condition it's with the commands if and else, we can using the next way:

current_age = int(input("Please type your current age: "))
if current_age < 18:
    print("you are still young, don't worry so much")
else:
    print("you are an old man, you should start to worry about it")
